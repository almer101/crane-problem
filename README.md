# The Crane Problem

This is the problem my friend and myself came up with and saw in it the potential for some mental gymnastics.

The problem formulation and the solution can be found [here](derivation/derivation.pdf).

## Implementation

Since it is hard to visualize if such a solution actually works I wrote a Python program that simulates the crane rotation and the movement of the load along the arm of the crane.
