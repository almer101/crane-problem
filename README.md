# The Crane Problem

This is the problem my friend and myself came up with and saw in it the potential for some mental gymnastics. In short, the question we had was that, looking at the crane from above, is it possible that the load carried by the crane always has a linear path from some starting point to its destination.

The detailed problem formulation and the solution can be found [here](derivation/derivation.pdf).

## Implementation

Since it is hard to visualize if such a solution actually works I wrote a Python program that simulates the crane rotation and the movement of the load along the arm of the crane.
